**Project Details :**
This is a simple project that uses *Luhn’s algorithm* to validate a user's credit card. The program works for all popular cards like **Visa**, **Amex**, **MasterCard**, **etc**. Luhn’s algorithm checks for basic validations; for example, a Visa card should start with 4 and then moves on to complex digit-wise calculations. It is a good program to learn because most e-commerce transactions require credit card validation.
